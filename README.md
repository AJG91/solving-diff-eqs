# Solving differential equations
A repository used to showcase how one can solve differential equations using Python.

## Getting Started

* This project relies on `python=3.10`. It was not tested with different versions.
  To view the entire list of required packages, see `environment.yml`.
* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Once you have `cd` into this repo, create a virtual environment (assuming you have `conda` installed) via
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
* Enter the virtual environment with `conda activate solve-ode-env`
* Install the `libraries` package in the repo root directory using `pip install -e .`
  (you only need the `-e` option if you intend to edit the source code in `libraries/`).
